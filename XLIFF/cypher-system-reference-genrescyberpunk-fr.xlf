        <source>Artificial intelligence (AI) generally means machine intelligence or computer intelligence—the ability of a nonhuman system to think and reason. In cyberpunk, AIs range from helper apps on devices (including smart weapons that help the user target foes) to self‑acting machines (such as military or police robots) to powerful programs running on supercomputers or distributed across a computer network. AI can be broken into four general categories: weak, sim, strong, and post‑singularity.
Weak AI: An algorithmic‑based code with specific tasks, such as a chess bot, smart pistol, or voice‑activated helper app on a smartphone. It can’t do anything except what it was programmed to do.</source>

        <source>A brainslide is a digital recording of the subject’s experience that plays directly into the viewer’s senses. When a character plays a brainslide, they experience the recorded events from the perspective of the subject who recorded them. This is an immersive experience that includes all major senses—the character playing a brainslide truly feels as though they are in the position of the individual who recorded it. This means that the spectator is also bound by the recorder’s choices: if a character has a brainslide of a murder they are trying to solve, but the person who recorded the brainslide was facing away from the action, then the character will not be able to see who the killer was. They will see, hear, smell, taste and feel precisely what the recorder experienced in the moment.</source>

The result is an improved version of a D-engram that can respond to a reasonable range of questions about the subject, perhaps with the subject’s emotional responses coded into the answers. For example, if the politician engram was given data from an interview where the politician admitted to an affair and love child that they felt guilty about, the engram could talk about those subjects, perhaps rebuffing initial questions and only opening up about it if pressed about it. The engram might even invent false details to bolster its answers, or lie about things if the subject is known to lie. The engram only knows the data it is given; building an engram with inaccurate or false data (such as a “tell-all” book written by someone who doesn’t actually know anything about the subject) means it confidently gives answers that it doesn’t understand are incorrect.</source>

Providing these details takes a lot of time—at least several weeks of multiple-hour sessions to extensively cover the subject’s history and opinions. Because of this time investment, creating a B-engram of someone without their knowledge or cooperation is very difficult, and mainly used by subjects who want a “double” to take their place so they can remain hidden, or by people whose bodies and/or minds are failing and see becoming an engram as the only way to live on (perhaps in a robotic humanoid body) once they die.</source>

The PCs must succeed on three cyberspace navigation rolls, each of which must be made in a different node (or frame, if they’re trying to find a particular frame in a big node). The difficulty of each roll is set by the level of the frame or node they’re seeking. Each failure means the subsequent difficulty is hindered by one step.

        <source>Most implants aren’t made of the high-strength plastic and steel used to build cars and furniture. They need to be light enough that a human equipped with one can still move and act normally. After all, what good is a cybernetic arm if it weighs 50 pounds (22 kg) and your back frequently hurts trying to compensate for that weight? Instead, the structural and motorized parts of implants are made of light materials like fiberglass and lightweight plastic or carbon tubes (often hollow, like bird bones). The surface is usually plastiflesh, a lifelike malleable material that’s pliable enough to bend at the joints and sensitive enough to respond to touch stimuli. In between the structure and the surface are circuits, sensors, power conduits, and other technical bits that allow the implant to do its job and let the user control it like an organic limb. Altogether, this means an implant is about as durable and breakable as an organic limb; a knife slices through plastiflesh and ultrafine wiring as easily as skin and muscle, and a bullet can shatter a cybernetic femur about as easily as it does a bone one.</source>

        <source>SHITS (Spontaneous Hypersensitive Induced Trauma Syndrome) is a term for the tendency for some people with cybernetics to experience hallucinations, dissociative events, and fits of violence. The exact cause is unknown, and there is currently no funding available for researching it, so medical workers only have anecdotal evidence for its causes. The only common factor is that all people with these symptoms have one or more extreme cybernetic implants—something more unusual than a standard prosthetic limb, eye, or communicator. Planted news stories (propaganda) from the megacorporations suggest that the main factors are excessive cybernetics coupled with drug addiction (which, conveniently, absolves the megacorps of any responsibility). The truth is certainly much more complicated than that, with several of the following issues as contributing factors.</source>

        <source>Of course, those were just the beginning, and researchers (especially those with military funding) began to experiment with more radical cybernetics. Arms with built-in firearms, legs that can run as fast as a car, and wetware that accelerates reaction time or administers artificial combat hormones. Now these once-experimental devices are as common as a regular cybernetic eye or hand, but the technology and materials used to build them aren’t always safe, nor is the human brain always able to adapt to having a radically nonhuman body part. As far as users go, there will be people who handle it well, and people who don’t. Even a person who consciously accepts their radical cybernetic may experience phantom limb syndrome as a chronic medical condition. A person might successfully use their unusual cyberware all day, then have dreams or nightmares about how their body used to be. The more nonstandard cybernetics a person has, the more times their body and mind go through this process, and sometimes the mind doesn’t heal properly. For a physically fit and mentally healthy person, none of these things might be an issue. But if the patient has an existing inclination or medical issue—whether it’s childhood trauma, genetic vulnerability, subtle plastic allergy, or resentment about their injury (or their insurance company, or the quality of the cybernetic)—these factors can add up over time and push the patient toward a traumatic condition called SHITS.</source>

        <source>Crime: Crime, particularly violent crime, is everywhere. Armed gangs stake out small fiefdoms in city neighborhoods, carve warnings into the bodies of people who cross them, and engage in open warfare with rivals and the police. City police departments (historically ineffective, violent, and shielded from consequences) have huge budgets but still can’t make a dent in crime statistics, to the extent that they place bounties on various criminals and organizations in the hopes that vigilantes will do their jobs for them. People fear for their safety, and firearms are so ubiquitous you can buy a disposable 3D-printed gun from a vending machine. Living in this kind of stressful environment has long-term effects on a person’s mental and physical health; for some people, the end of that road is a SHITS episode where a person thinks that murderous violence is the way to solve all their problems.</source>

        <source>In a cyberpunk world, the megacorporations have overturned or disbanded governmental agencies that protect the environment and people. There’s lead in the paint. Asbestos in the insulation. Microplastics and pesticides in the food. Toxic and carcinogenic materials at work and at home. The ozone layer is wrecked. Acid rain is common. Dirty nuclear bombs have made many regions uninhabitable, and dust storms from those areas bring fallout into the cities. There’s no such thing as clean air or water any more, unless you’re rich enough to live in a sealed environment and have it piped in to you (even the standard city water on tap is partially contaminated). Everyone is being slowly poisoned, every day, all the time, causing physical and mental harm.</source>

        <source>Humans are social creatures (yes, even introverts) and need interaction with other people to remain mentally healthy. But crime, pollution, lack of public parks, and other factors in the cyberpunk setting discourage people from spending much time outside or socializing with anyone other than their immediate family and coworkers. The typical person is starved for human attention, conversation, and intimacy. Casual interactions—holophone calls, sports events, and going out to bars—aren’t enough. Watching immersive reality TV and soliciting sex workers scratch similar itches, but are only superficial connections. It’s no wonder that young people, especially those living in poverty, often turn to street gangs as a surrogate family. Others may use drugs to escape from reality, or at least stave off the symptoms of their loneliness. Isolation can lead to depression, which often makes someone isolate themself even further because they feel that nobody understands what they’re going through, which can lead to feelings of aimlessness and dissociation.</source>

Pepperoni in a tube. Hamburger in a tube. Vegetable stew in a tube. Cheese in a tube. Ice cream in a tube. Anything in a tube. Some people do basic cooking with these “ingredients” at home, making sad replicas of actual dishes out of various pastes, slimes, and slurries. Many just slurp their meals from the tube, maybe after a quick blast in the microwave.

If a corp can put a digital ad somewhere, they will—whether that’s commercials in elevators or multistory holograms on the sides of buildings—all blasting people with jingles, jump scares, and flashing lights. The near-constant screen time delays sleep, reduces sleep duration, decreases the efficiency and rewards of sleep, and alters circadian rhythms and hormone production. Extensive use of screens instead of physical activities often leads to sedentary behavior, obesity, and an overall reduction in physical fitness—and relentless advertising means people are more likely to choose unhealthy foods, exacerbating this trend. Too much screen time increases the likelihood of depression, causes an addictive loop (due to stimulating brain chemicals), increases aggression, harms a person’s ability to read emotional cues, and (if exposed to violent media) desensitizes them toward violence. VR technology or neural stimulation media (such as brainslides) are even more intense and more harmful in the long run than screens, especially in children and young adults.</source>

A nearly-harmless biological virus might undergo a mutation that gives it an adverse effect on a body interfacing with cybernetics, or causes it to jump from one symbiotic bacterial species to another which then alters its behavior in the human host. A bit of erratic code in cyberware or a malicious worm can cause biofeedback in the user or trigger unusual nervous system activity that affects the user's perception or emotions. Either or both of these causes can go undetected by medical professionals, creating an "invisible disease" with symptoms but no obvious cause.

The removal can have any of the following effects: reducing the frequency of the episodes (either by reducing the GM intrusion range or having the GM “skip” having some triggers provoke a reaction), easing the character’s defense rolls against an episode, or reducing the Intellect damage from an episode. Of course, removing some assistive prosthetics has its own set of problems; for example, removing a person’s cybernetic arm means they have to get by without an arm, although they can still opt for a standard prosthetic instead of an extreme one. Fortunately, replacing oversized, weaponized, or inhuman-looking cybernetics with standard or realistic prostheses allows the character normal functioning and still seems to reduce the risk of SHITS.</source>

For example, choosing the “increasing capabilities” option and adding more points to the character’s Intellect Pool helps stave off their mental decline. The GM can allow the character to choose the “skill” advancement and become trained or specialized in “resisting SHITS,” which helps reduce further mental damage. (Although the “skill” advancement option doesn’t allow a character to choose Intellect defense as a general skill, they can choose this specific skill that affects these kinds of Intellect defense tasks.) Finally, instead of choosing the “moving toward perfection” option, the GM can let the character reduce their Intellect Edge by 1 and permanently add 2 to their Intellect Pool, in effect partially reversing some of the harm from SHITS.</source>

        <source>Some players might want their character to become afflicted with SHITS perhaps as part of the fall from grace character arc. Every triggering episode the character experiences counts as a step in the arc (earning the character XP). The player could voluntarily fail defense rolls against SHITS episodes—or even ask the GM for additional episodes—because they want the character to experience the arc. The climax of the arc is the character pushing themself too hard, losing control, and becoming a GM-controlled character.</source>

        <source>Normally, a PC attempting to damage an object held by a foe is a minor effect on an attack roll, followed by a Might roll against the object’s level, and the extent of the damage depends on how successful the attack was.

        <source>To remove surgically integrated chrome, characters must attempt two rolls against the deceased foe’s level. The first roll is based on knowledge, to see if the characters can figure out how to detach the cyberware without damaging any crucial components. This roll can be retried. The second roll, based on dexterity, determines how well they execute the removal. If this roll is failed, the cybernetics are damaged in the process of removal. Characters can bypass one or both of these rolls by taking the corpse to an especially unscrupulous chopper, though the chopper’s fee might exceed the resale value. If characters get a chopper to install the salvaged chrome, the fee will almost certainly exceed the piece’s value.</source>

        <source>The prices in this book are listed with a dollar sign (). With the rise of megacorporations, the role of the government in regulating currency (such as the US dollar) has dwindled. As an additional way of representing the dystopia of the cyberpunk genre, you may have the megacorps exploit this loss of regulation by issuing their own currency, similar to scrip issued by mining companies in remote towns at the turn of the 20th century. Megacorps use their company-branded scrip to pay their employees, and company-owned retail centers only accept their own currency for payments.</source>

These short-term adjustments really hurt regular people who were expecting to make critical purchases on payday, only to find that their account is worth half of what they expected. Fortunately, these manipulations are rare because the company doesn’t want to risk that other corporations might take advantage of the dip, or the change might trigger a spike in inflation—but if doing so creates a short-term advantage for the megacorporation without a long-term disadvantage, it’ll happen at some point (followed by the currency bouncing back after the damage has been done to regular people).</source>

        <source>For freelancers (such as typical cyberpunk PCs), dealing with multiple corpocurrencies is complicated. They may want to refuse jobs that pay in corpocurrency from a megacorp they dislike. Taking cashcards from downed corpo foes could mean they end up with a significant amount of money that they can’t or won’t use without first getting it exchanged, either at an above-the-table business (which can draw the attention of the hostile megacorp) or by paying a huge fee on the black market. A particularly interesting weapon or bit of chrome might only be available from one particular megacorp, requiring the characters to acquire and spend that corp’s currency. A megacorp’s fixer might offer an especially high payment in their corpocurrency in order to get the PCs under their thumb, or to lock them out of work for a rival corp. For PCs whose goal is to get rich, they need to figure out if having moderate amounts in eight different currencies feels as wealthy as having one big stash in a favored currency.</source>

After all, a duffel bag could have hundreds of doses of an illegal street drug, and it would break the game’s plausibility if each dose was a cypher.</source>

        <source>Description: Pixel® is an anesthetic and analgesic developed by Zeerosh. Though it’s technically only available by prescription—and only prescribed in rare cases—Pixel® is most commonly used by netrunners, because it induces a trancelike state that eases their integration into the matrix. The drug is easy to produce with a basic 3D printer, and trivial with the RxHypo3D. Netrunners tend to print their own supply, but it can sometimes be found in convenience stores under alternate names to dodge trademark protection.</source>

The first subtask’s difficulty is 1, and each successive task’s difficulty increases by 1 until the character reaches the last, hardest task with a difficulty equal to the cypher’s assessed difficulty. Generally, subtask attempts occur at equally divided intervals over the course of the full time required to write the program. If the character fails on a subtask, the cypher isn’t ruined. Instead, the character only wasted the time spent on that subtask, and they can spend that much time again to try and succeed at the same subtask. Effort cannot be applied to any cypher-crafting task or subtask that takes longer than one day.</source>

        <source>When characters anticipate a major showdown, hackers can prepare simple attacks in advance. The player describes what their character does to prepare, then rolls to determine how effective that preparation really was. The difficulty level equals the number of prepared actions; for example, if a hacker is preparing 3 actions, the roll’s target number is 9. The roll can be retried if failed, with the target number remaining the same; however, each failure decreases the final number of prepared actions by 1.</source>

However, unusual events—a civil war, a nuclear strike on a foreign country, or poor economic choices by a dictator—can trigger a sudden spike in inflation, adjusting the cost of all goods by 5% to 10% in a single month. It is rare for inflation prices to settle back down; it’s much more likely that inflation flattens after a spike and remains flat until the overall prices catch up to what they “should be” in a normal annual inflation cycle.</source>

In severe cases, prices might double every few days, rendering existing currencies almost worthless in a very short amount of time. In a cyberpunk setting, megacorporations can try to curtail hyperinflation with several drastic and obscure methods, most of which are unseen to the typical person on the street but include temporarily freezing digital assets (such as money accounts with corpo-controlled banks). If these attempts work, prices can stabilize after a couple of months, but the damage has been done, with more people ending up in poverty or homeless.</source>

        <source>In a genre where people literally replace much of their body with machine technology, picking a different character focus is well within the realm of possibility. The Cypher System Rulebook already has information about switching a character’s descriptor or focus, so all that the character needs is a narrative (in-game) reason for it. Maybe the character had to plug an experimental bio-organic chip into their brain implant, or got splashed with weird nanobots that dug into their organics and chrome and make radical changes, or they succumbed to SHITS and had to be institutionalized and reprogrammed, or a generous (or sadistic) chopper decided to replace all of their cybernetics with ones that grant different abilities. In a weirder cyberpunk game that mixes in other genres, other justifications for this sort of character change include alien experimentation, possession by a ghost (or engram or AI), dimensional bleed, a significant mutation, or time travel reworking some aspect of the character’s past.</source>

        <source>Using the relationship level rules from the Cypher System Rulebook captures how romantic and platonic relationships can both deepen and weaken over time. A character who relies on an NPC contact for aid will have to put work into building that bond, increasing the relationship level. Inappropriate or careless behavior can lower the relationship level, meaning that characters must put work into rebuilding it. A relationship’s level also dictates the NPC’s actions in relation to the character—how likely are they to do the character an inconvenient favor? How likely are they drop everything to save the character from a deadly situation?</source>

        <source>In a typical fantasy campaign where the PCs wander from village to village dealing with local problems, the required travel time between adventure locations acts to slow down the overall timeline of the campaign. In a cyberpunk campaign, particularly one taking place almost exclusively in and around one major city, there’s no longer a travel-induced brake on the timeline. Instead, the GM should use a more direct method: forcing the characters to take time off in between their active gigs. Here are some easy ways to do this.</source>

        <source>The rules assume that character advancements take place almost instantly, without any need for training or study, even if it means the character is suddenly gaining new abilities, new skills, or adding to their stat pools. An easy way to slow a campaign timeline is to require some story-induced downtime to justify gaining (or mastering) a new ability. A character increasing their Might or Speed Pool needs to spend some time at the gym or dojo. One adding to their Intellect Pool needs to take a college class or attend a meditation retreat. Learning how to use a new ability requires the character to practice, watch holotutorials, or both. And so on. An easy guideline is to have the character spend about a week of downtime for each advancement they choose; this in itself means extending the campaign timeline by at least 20 weeks (five tears beyond tier 1, with four advancements each).</source>

        <source>The GM should encourage the players to see their characters getting paid as a windfall situation: instead of struggling to meet their day-to-day expenses, the characters have some money to burn. They can pay off debts, pick out some new equipment and cybernetics, party or vacation a bit, and perhaps find a safer or sexier place to live. Even if the GM hand-waves basic expenses like rent, food, clothing, and so on (with the assumption that the characters are spending some of their time outside of a game session doing boring, risk-free work to pay for their mediocre standard of living), the extra money from a typical gig gives the PCs some time to cool off and distract themselves from their dystopian existence. Not taking time off to relax is bad for a person’s mental health, and that sort of stress can build up and lead to SHITS. Even in a campaign where SHITS isn’t really something PCs have to deal with, the GM can encourage downtime by hindering the characters’ Intellect-based tasks (starting with one step, increasing about one step per week), reflecting their ongoing fatigue, emotional damage, and burnout.</source>

        <source>The lasting damage rule gives a character an injury that they can’t fix with a simple recovery roll. They only recover slowly during light activity or complete rest. Using this rule, a typical 4-point wound from a medium pistol becomes something that requires four days of complete bed rest, or twelve days of regular activity, during which time the character isn’t at full strength. Diseases, poisons, and even something or even something like a grenade’s explosioncould trigger a group GM intrusion for lasting damage that leaves all of the PCs wanting some extra time to heal. Also, this section’s entry on lasting damage encourages the GM to sometimes damage or destroy a character’s cybernetics—a bloodless but hard-hitting way to show the lethality of dystopian cyberpunk. More of these attacks also push characters to slow down a little bit.</source>

        <source>Getting a cybernetic implant requires surgery, and a body needs time after surgery to heal, build up strength, and learn how to use the newly implanted device so it functions as automatically as the user’s own limbs. A minor surgical procedure typically leaves a person sore and stiff for a few days. A major procedure requires weeks or even a couple of months before the character feels back to normal again.

Likewise, one good whack with an omega bat might bend or break a character’s cybernetic arm, inflicting lasting damage that takes a while for the implant’s self-repair mode to fix (or the character could just have a brand-new arm installed, either of the same type or an upgrade).</source>

Getting burned by a flamethrower or falling into a vat of acid is easily remedied by a comprehensive skin cybernetic, and the character has the option of realistic plastiflesh or something more artificial-looking (such as dermachrome).

        <source>There are three primary ways that characters earn XP in the Cypher System: GM intrusions, character arcs, and GM awards for discoveries and story events. The assumption is that each character will spend about half their XP on immediate benefits (rerolling a d20) and short- and medium-term benefits, and half on advancement and long-term benefits. However, each player group probably has at least one outlier—the one who hoards XP for advancement and almost never uses it for rerolls, or who uses most of it on rerolls and rarely on advancement. Although both are reasonable options in a short-term game, in a long-term campaign where the characters reach tier 3 and higher, a character who rarely advances ends up weaker and with fewer options than a higher-tier character. For a long-term campaign, the GM can prevent this power disparity by using the following guidelines for spending XP:</source>

        <source>You should also keep an eye on the individual XP totals for each character, just in case one character keeps ending up with a surplus of one kind and a scarcity in the other. (The player might be fine with this imbalance, but if not it’s an opportunity for you to balance the scales, either by trading XP between the two categories or using the next session to award more of the XP they need.) This method is also a good way to encourage players to choose character arcs if they want to advance to higher tiers, as they can’t rely on GM intrusion XP for advancement.</source>

Holograms obviously don’t look real; they’re translucent images that overlay whatever is behind them, and show up best when the ambient light level is low enough that the hologram appears much brighter than its surroundings, such as when it’s heavily overcast or at night. The hologram device is basically a cluster of tiny image projectors that work together in 3D space to create a semi-realistic image; obscuring or blocking one or more of the projectors degrades and disrupts the image, often with hideous results.</source>

        <source>Normally a character’s Effort score is the limit to how many levels of Effort they can apply to a task. However, in a cyberpunk game, firearms are ubiquitous, life-threatening injuries are common, and over-the-top violence is the norm. To represent this paradigm, treat a character’s Effort score as 6 for the purpose of applying levels of Effort to damage. In other words, when it comes to using Effort for extra damage, a character can exceed their normal Effort limit (but not beyond the normal maximum of 6 levels of Effort).</source>

        <source>The GM is free to disallow players from using the ultimate damage rule against important NPCs (such as “bosses”) where huge damage can end a fight quickly and anticlimactically. For those situations, the GM should inform the player (before any Pool points are spent) that they can’t exceed their Effort limit, and then the player decides if they want to apply Effort at all (anywhere from none up to their normal Effort limit). Alternatively, the GM can let the player exceed the normal Effort limit and spend the Pool points, then use a GM intrusion to reveal the NPC’s “plot armor” against the ultimate damage (in a way, they’re recompensating the character for the high Pool point expenditure); the player does not have the option to spend 1 XP and refuse this intrusion.</source>

        <source>Variations are small tweaks to a common weapon, giving it an unusual benefit or detriment that makes it stand out. Rather than filling the Equipment section with dozens of near-identical weapons (which would be cumbersome to read and use), like one brand-name pistol having a six-round clip and another having an eight-round clip, you can use the Weapon Variations Table to quickly make a weapon just a little bit unique. For simplicity, roll on the table once each session that any character picks up a new weapon.</source>

        <source>The standard character types are meant to be generic enough to allow you to create most characters in any genre, especially with the use of flavors. However, it’s also possible to directly customize the various types so they fit the parameters of a specific genre. This section presents an updated cyberpunk variant of each of the four standard types, focusing on the changes to the rules content for those types (use the standard versions of the type’s Individual Role, Group Role, Societal Role, and Advanced information).</source>

        <source>Sensor Scan (2 Intellect points): You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area; the results of your scan are compared to a database of information (facial recognition, object recognition, police database, and so on) to determine what it is you’re looking at. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the objects and creatures in that area. For example, you might learn that a device is made of metal, plastic, and electronics. You might learn a person’s name, occupation, whether or not they have any standard cybernetics, and that they have several outstanding parking tickets. You might learn that the creature in front of you is an exotic mammal (such as a tapir), and that owning it requires an expensive permit. However, this ability doesn’t tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don’t know what the metal and plastic device does—it might be a radio or a land mine. In the second, you don’t know the person is intent on harming you. In the third, you don’t know if the creature is dangerous. The information you do get from the initial scan probably gives you enough of a lead to perform an internet search to find more information. Many materials (such as lead shielding, a Faraday cage, or concrete) prevent or hinder scanning. Action.</source>

        <source>Translation App: You have adaptive learning software installed in your communicator implant. After hearing an unfamiliar human language spoken for a few minutes, the software deciphers the language and translates it for you, either directly into your ear or in your vision as holophone subtitles. If you choose, you can have the software translate what you say into this language, projecting it audibly from an implanted speaker. The software’s translation improves the longer it can listen to a source language, picking up idioms and slang after a few hours. Enabler.</source>

        <source>Beckon Hack (3 Intellect points): You hack a foe’s brain implant, tricking them into hearing or seeing something they think they need to investigate. They might interpret this as someone calling their name, an ally waving for them to approach, or a text message asking them to move to a specific location. If your Intellect-based roll against the creature is successful, on their next turn they move up to a short distance to where you indicated, without thinking anything is amiss. The foe must be within short range and able to understand you. The command can’t inflict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so you can’t make them step off of a roof or into a trash compactor. Once the creature moves to the designated location, they are free to act normally (depending on the circumstances, they might think they imagined or misheard the call, that someone is playing a trick on them, or there is something suspicious going on). The foe can still defend themselves normally and return an attack if one is made on them. Action.</source>

        <source>Peaceblock Hack (4+ Intellect points): You hack a foe’s brain implant, triggering pain whenever they attempt to harm a creature you specify. The foe must be level 3 or lower and within short range. For the next minute, the foe’s harmful actions against the designated creature are hindered by two steps, and the foe automatically take 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) every time they try to touch, strike, or harm the designated creature. The foe immediately recognizes (without needing to attack first) that acting against the creature will be harmful. The foe knows when the effect ends, remembers the earlier aversion, and can immediately act normally. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one minute.

        <source>Corpse Datadump (3 Intellect points): You touch the remains of a recently killed creature and make an Intellect-based roll to read data from its brain cybernetics. The GM sets the difficulty based on the amount of time that has passed since the creature died. A creature that has been dead for only a few minutes is a difficulty 2 task, one that has been dead for an hour is a difficulty 4 task, and one that has been dead for a few days is a difficulty 9 task. If you succeed, you can browse the corpse’s memories in a virtual environment as if you were speaking to its living self. This lasts about one minute, after which time the environment degrades. The creature is limited to what it knew in life, though it cannot recall minor memories, only big events of importance to it. When the effect ends, or if you fail the roll, the creature’s memory data becomes corrupted and you can gain no further information from it. Action.</source>

        <source>Beckon Hack (3 Intellect points): You hack a foe’s brain implant, tricking them into hearing or seeing something they think they need to investigate. They might interpret this as someone calling their name, an ally waving for them to approach, or a text message asking them to move to a specific location. If your Intellect-based roll against the creature is successful, on their next turn they move up to a short distance to where you indicated, without thinking anything is amiss. The foe must be within short range and able to understand you. The command can’t inflict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so you can’t make them step off of a roof or into a trash compactor. Once the creature moves to the designated location, they are free to act normally (depending on the circumstances, they might think they imagined or misheard the call, that someone is playing a trick on them, or there is something suspicious going on). The foe can still defend themselves normally and return an attack if one is made on them. Action.</source>

The foe must be level 3 or lower and within short range.

The foe immediately recognizes (without needing to attack first) that acting against the creature will be harmful. The foe knows when the effect ends, remembers the earlier aversion, and can immediately act normally. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to peaceblock a level 6 target (three levels above the normal limit) or block them for four minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must apply three levels of Effort.

        <source>SHITS Hack (7 Intellect points): A foe within short range temporarily experiences SHITS and spends its next turn attacking the nearest creature (if multiple creatures are the same distance away, you can choose which one they attack).

You have a unique insight about crime, or at least how to interface with the criminal world so you can get your next score. You know you have your addiction under control—your drug of choice helps you cope with your illness, or the crapsack world you live in. Or you’re looking for help. Or you need to hit rock bottom before you realize how serious your problem is. Or maybe you’re too stubborn to realize this’ll kill you sooner rather than later.

A focus such as Awakens Dreams is a reasonable choice for a fantasy setting, or even a modern or futuristic setting with psychic powers, but it would be out of place if used as-is for cyberpunk.</source>

Unless the GM wants teleportation to be an aspect of their setting, they should pick an alternative tier 6 ability in place of Chamber of Dreams, such as Infer Thoughts or Terrifying Gaze.

The character probably was raised with the expectation that they’d eventually inherit their parent’s role or otherwise take a prominent position within the company.

This might happen on five consecutive nights (perhaps due to the proximity of a military satellite broadcasting a signal) or occur at shorter but more frequent intervals, such as once every six days (perhaps due to some component needing to recharge or self-repair before it activates again).</source>

        <source>Fuses Flesh and Steel. This focus in the Cypher System Rulebook assumes a setting where cybernetics are rare or experimental. In particular, the Enhanced Body ability is powerful, but has a drawback that the character’s inorganic parts have to be repaired rather than healing naturally like flesh. In a typical cyberpunk setting, cybernetics have advanced beyond that early technology, and self-repair mechanisms (whether using nanobots or some other technology) allow a cyborg character to heal without needing repairs like a machine. The new cybernetic foci presented in this section present alternatives to Enhanced Body—less powerful, but without the requires-repair drawback. The GM may allow a character to choose Fuses Flesh and Steel as their focus, perhaps representing an older character with obsolete or “retro” technology, but most players who want a heavily-chromed character focus should instead select one of the new foci presented here.</source>

On your action, if the drone is next to you, it serves as an asset for one attack you make on your turn.

When you trigger this ability, you gain an asset on one defense roll as your software outlines foes and predicts their attacks. Alternatively, you can use the heads-up display to magnify your vision, increasing your vision range to 5 miles (8 km) for two rounds. If you apply one level of Effort, you can also see through basic materials (such as wood, concrete, plastic, and stone) to a short distance in false color images. If you apply two levels of Effort, you can see through special materials (such as solid lead or other substances) to an immediate distance in false color images; however, the GM might require you to succeed at an Intellect-based task first, depending on the material blocking your armor’s sensors.

The kiosk scanner automatically reports any illegal items it scans to the city police—but it still pays you for them. Likewise, if the scan identifies an item used to commit a crime (such as a legal pistol used in a cold-blooded murder), the kiosk reports it. The kiosk also records your image and uses facial recognition to identify you, which is how many dumb criminals get caught. The kiosk dumps its bought materials into an underground receptable (not accessible from the sidewalk) which is emptied and sorted by the owner on a regular basis.</source>

        <source>If you want to avoid the automatic surveillance of a kiosk, or want to get more money for your items, you’ll need to find an interested buyer. Preferably one who is trustworthy, or at least not going to rip you off. At best, you might get 75% of the item’s value instead of just 30–50%, but these kinds of transactions often have strings attached.</source>

        <source>Although most weapons you’ll find in shops (or the hands of foes) are mass-produced and essentially identical to all the others of that make and model, some weapons have a quirk that makes them unusual—sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes a little of both. For example, a pistol might inflict extra damage on a roll of 19 or higher, have double the normal ammunition capacity, or jam more often. The GM will let you know if a particular weapon has a variation.</source>

        <source>CancelYou® stunner pistol: This Halo-manufactured light weapon looks like a cross between a heavy flashlight and a pistol with a snub nose. It launches multiple metal darts at one creature, with each dart trailing a thin wire, and releases a strong electrical current through the wires into the creature. The stunner fires out to short range, but attacks beyond immediate range are hindered because the darts tend to go astray. A struck creature of level 2 or lower falls prone and can’t take actions for a round or two; PCs and creatures of level 3 or higher do not fall prone or lose their actions, and instead are hindered by two steps for the next round or two. Retracting the wires for another shot is an action; the weapon usually can be fired two or three times before it needs a one-hour recharge. CancelYou GM intrusion suggestion: The weapon strikes and stuns a bystander; the weapon causes a medical complication that inflicts 4 points of damage (ignores Armor) to the creature.</source>

        <source>Raptor® Smart Pistol (medium or heavy): This Immortech pistol has an AI assistant that increases accuracy. If the wielder uses an action to aim at a target, or uses a level of Effort to ease the attack against the target, the AI locks on to that target, granting the wielder an asset to all later attacks with the pistol against that target (by a combination of steering the wielder’s hand and curving the bullets mid-flight). The target lock ends if the wielder shoots at a different target or stops holding the weapon.

It can’t be reloaded (there’s no way to open it, but it can be broken in half if you really need to get the bullets out of it). Most people who choose a Zeerok do so because they need a cheap firearm and just want to be able to scare off a threatening person. It’s also fingerprint-resistant and ballistics-anonymizing to make it harder to trace expended bullets back to the weapon that fired it.

        <source>Swarm®: This Immortech attachment divides the weapon’s bullets into smaller dart-like projectiles that travel in a cluster toward one target—two projectiles for a light weapon, four for a medium weapon, or six for a heavy weapon. As a single action, the wielder makes a separate hindered attack for each projectile. The user remains limited by the amount of Effort they can apply on one action; because these are separate attacks, the opponent’s Armor applies to each of them. Anything that modifies the weapon’s or wielder’s attack or damage applies to all of these attacks, unless it’s specifically tied to a single attack. A projectile that hits inflicts 1 point of damage. Swarm attachments have a higher tendency to jam the weapon; the GM intrusion range for the character’s attacks with the weapon increases by 3, and any intrusions from this increased intrusion range mean the weapon jams and can’t be fired until the character spends a few rounds dislodging the bullet fragments.</source>

        <source>Land mine: An explosive charge with a trigger, placed on or under the ground. Typical triggers are a top-surface button (activated by pressure, such as from a foot or tire), a motion sensor, a tripwire (extending up to a short distance away), or a radio receiver that can be triggered manually by an operator; advanced models can be programmed to ignore specific individuals. Setting up a mine takes several rounds. Antipersonnel mines are designed to kill people; these usually launch a projectile into the air, which explodes and sends shrapnel in all directions. Some antipersonnel mines use shaped charges so the blast area is a cone or rather than a sphere. Antitank mines direct their explosion upward to disable a passing vehicle (even if the explosion doesn’t destroy the vehicle, it usually damages the wheels or treads enough to prevent it from moving). A triggered mine creates a level 4 explosion, inflicting 8 points of damage in a short area and 4 points in the surrounding short area. A character who makes a Speed defense roll against the mine takes half damage. Mines with motion sensors or radio receivers can be hacked.</source>

        <source>The drugs detailed in this section behave similarly to artifacts, with short-term benefits and potential drawbacks. Their prices depend on the source and availability. Over the counter (OTC) drugs are inexpensive and ubiquitous. Rx Only drugs are created for therapeutic purposes; if they’re prescribed to a character, the price ranges from $25 to $100 per week and may be covered by the character’s health insurance. Of course, these drugs can be purchased without a prescription, if you know someone willing to sell. Though street drugs still have in-game benefits, they are created solely for recreational purposes, and the price is set at the dealer’s discretion.</source>

        <source>One important take-away from this is you can’t get them back. Sure, maybe you could hire someone to keep your old organic bits “on ice” just in case you want to get them reattached, but it’s easier to forget about them. Especially if you can buy a premium cybernetic that works as well or better than the original and also looks completely organic. Or hand over a lot of money to a corp, for them to regrow your original parts using your own DNA. But most people just stick with cybernetics. (After all, it’s cyberpunk, not biopunk.)</source>

        <source>The point is that if your cybernetic fails or is damaged, you don’t have your original meat-bits to fall back on. Your gorilla arms get shot off? You’re armless until you can get them replaced. Optics burn out from a nasty virus? You’re blind until you can get a clean set installed. Your replacement heart gets fried by an electrical pulse? You’re dead (barring CPR and an emergency transplant). Of course, bad things can happen to your original organics, so you’re not actually worse off if you get cyberware … but you need to think of them as permanent changes to your body. Like how tattoos used to be.</source>

        <source>FuBo®: Immortech pioneered this technology for a full-body cybernetic replacement—a human head kept alive by a fully-cybernetic body. The typical setup replaces everything from the neck down, although more extreme conversions (such as only retaining the person’s eyes and brain, or just the brain) are available at a 20% higher cost. Installing a FuBo is a radical procedure and is normally only done for people with extensive critical injuries, a debilitating medical condition that can’t be corrected with smaller-scale cyberware, or when the brain is intact and there are no other options to save a person’s life.</source>

(The GM might need to hand-wave or explain some aspects of how your artificial body interacts with some of the rules, but the intent is that your character is just as capable and functional as a fully-organic or partly-organic character.)</source>

        <source>Many cyphers in a cyberpunk setting are some kind of drug—perhaps a street drug, designer drug, or megacorporation-crafted combat drug. Altogether, these are considered “pharmaceutical cyphers,” and they include most inhaler and pill cyphers. Character abilities and other game mechanics that affect poisons have a similar effect on pharmaceutical cyphers (although these shouldn’t prevent a character from intentionally using a pharmaceutical cypher).</source>

        <source>Cyberpunk also allows for cyphers in the form of software apps, which can be downloaded onto any device that can store data, such as a laptop, computer chip, smart weapon, smart phone, or communicator implant. Technically these are subtle cyphers because they’re not distinct physical objects. The benefit of having an app cypher is that (like a manifest cypher) a character could give or trade an app to another person by either handing over the device it’s stored on or (more commonly) digitally transferring the app from its current device to a new one, which automatically deletes it from the current device.</source>

        <source>Effect: This pistol-like device fires a barrage of dart-like projectiles (equal to the level of the cypher) at one target within short range. As a single action, the user makes a separate hindered attack for each projectile. The user remains limited by the amount of Effort they can apply on one action; because these are separate attacks, the opponent’s Armor applies to each of them. Anything that modifies the user’s attack or damage applies to all of these attacks, unless it’s specifically tied to a single attack. A dart that hits inflicts 2 points of damage.</source>

        <source>A focusing module is an especially rare artifact that augments certain abilities from a character’s focus. It has wired and wireless connections to the character’s cybernetics, and may be an implanted device (and therefore cyberware) or merely worn (and therefore equipment). Most focusing modules are unique creations and originate from a megacorporation with a vested interest in a particularly talented operative. In other words, they’re not meant to be random discoveries in a CEO’s office safe, but specific equipment for a particular PC or NPC, made by people who know what the character is capable of.</source>

        <source>A focusing module Is meant to be used by a character who has the focus the module augments; it does nothing if used by a character who doesn’t have that focus. The level of the artifact determines what tiers of focus abilities it augments (a level 4 module affects a tier 1 ability, a level 5 module affects a tier 2 ability, and so on). All focusing module abilities based on artifact level are cumulative (a level 5 focusing module also does everything that a level 4 focusing module does). A focusing module normally augments only one focus ability at each tier.</source>

Sometimes this augmentation applies to only certain ways the ability can be used and doesn’t affect its normal use. For example, the level 7 Moves Like a Cat module lets the wearer hinder their Quick Strike attack to hinder their foe for an additional round, but they can still make a non-hindered Quick Strike that only affects the foe for one round, just like the unmodified ability.</source>

If the wielder uses an action to aim at a target, or uses a level of Effort to ease the attack against the target, the AI locks on to that target, granting the wielder an asset to all later attacks with the pistol against that target (by a combination of steering the wielder’s hand and curving the bullets mid-flight). The target lock ends if the wielder shoots at a different target or stops holding the weapon. Using the AI requires the user to have Smart Link cyberware installed (without it, the weapon works like a standard pistol).</source>

        <source>The pistol’s AI hardware includes a personality program and miniature holoprojector, able to create a hand-sized image of a friendly cartoon woman’s face near the weapon. This program, Gladys, is curious, talkative, capable of learning and remembering, and able to perform routine internet tasks (such as searching for local restaurant, looking up trivia, and so on). However, she often speaks up at inopportune times, is easily shocked by extreme violence, and sulks if not treated kindly or ignored. If sufficiently annoyed, she may disable the weapon’s targeting assistance, bend her bullets away from foes, or shut down the weapon entirely, only relenting if the user makes a sincere apology and “treats” her with a careful cleaning and takes her on a “date” to see something entertaining (such as a sports event, movie, or holoprogram).</source>

To activate it, the user must place a fresh DNA sample (such as a few drops of blood, hairs with the follicle cells still attached, or skin scrapings) in the connected receptable. The sample is scanned and its DNA sequenced, after which it begins to grow a clone from that DNA over the next 3d6 months (2d6 months for artifact level 9 or higher). At the end of this time, a full-grown creature, identical in every physical way to the DNA donor, emerges from the tank, and the artifact deactivates. The clone is a level 1 creature and has no memories or knowledge—essentially a blank slate operating on instinct and reacting to stimuli.</source>

The user can end this effect at any time. When the effect ends, the user’s tasks are hindered until they use a recovery roll. (The user can delay this hindering by activating the artifact again, but then will be hindered by one step for each activation.)</source>

If the wielder uses an action to aim at a target, or uses a level of Effort to ease the attack against the target, the AI locks on to that target, granting the wielder an asset to all later attacks with the pistol against that target (by a combination of steering the wielder’s hand and curving the bullets mid-flight).

        <source>Being scanned by the device is nauseating and traumatic, so normal practice is to restrain or fully sedate a living subject so they can’t escape. After one minute, the subject’s Intellect Pool is reduced to zero (which also moves them one step down the damage track); an NPC subject is instead reduced to half their normal health. After an hour, the subject moves another step down the damage track; an NPC instead is reduced to 0 health but is still alive. Completing the scan takes another one to four hours, depending on the amount of data in the brain, the extent of brain damage (if any), and various hard-to-quantify factors (including training to resist interrogation or torture).</source>

        <source>A suitcase nuke can be detected by the small amount of gamma rays it emits; however, sensor contamination from other harmless radiation sources, the limited range of accurate sensors, and the short (but not instant) time needed to get a reading means it is actually very difficult to detect the presence of such a small device.</source>

        <source>Effect: Created by Muxcom, this cyberware attaches to the user’s skeleton (on the side or back of the rib cage) and counts toward their limit of skeleton cybernetics. Learning to use the extra arm takes twenty to forty hours of practice and physical therapy; once this time is completed, the user can control the arm as easily as their other arms (organic or otherwise).</source>
