        <source>Character skills, favorable circumstances, or excellent equipment can decrease the difficulty of a task. For example, if a character is trained in climbing, they turn a difficulty 6 climb into a difficulty 5 climb. This is called **easing the difficulty by one step** (or just **easing the difficulty**, which assumes it’s eased by one step). If they are specialized in climbing, they turn a difficulty 6 climb into a difficulty 4 climb. This is called **easing the difficulty by two steps**. Decreasing the difficulty of a task can also be called **easing a task**. Some situations increase, or **hinder**, the difficulty of a task. If a task is hindered, it increases the difficulty by one step.</source>

In many campaigns, cyphers aren’t physical objects—they might be a spell cast upon a character, a blessing from a god, or just a quirk of fate that gives them a momentary advantage. In some campaigns, cyphers are physical objects that characters can carry.

The form that physical cyphers take depends on the setting.
