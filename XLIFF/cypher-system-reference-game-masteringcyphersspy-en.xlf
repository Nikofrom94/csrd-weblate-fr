        <source>Effect: Produces a tiny spying object that resists detection as a level 8 creature. The object moves at great speed, mapping and scanning an unknown area. It moves 500 feet (150 m) per level, scanning an area up to 50 feet (15 m) away from it. It identifies basic layout, creatures, and major energy sources. Its movement is blocked by any physical or energy barrier. At the end of its mapping run, it returns to the user and reports. If it discovers a predefined target during its run (such as “a creature of level 5 or higher,” “a locked door,” “a major energy source,” and so on), it detonates instead, dealing damage equal to the cypher’s level (half electrical damage, half shrapnel damage) to all creatures and objects in short range.</source>
