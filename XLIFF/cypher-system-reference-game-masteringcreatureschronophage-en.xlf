It can also use the ability to draw a victim’s attention and then launch a surprise attack from behind after it has effectively teleported.

        <source>GM intrusion: If a chronophage’s prey fails its Speed defense roll, the attack ignores Armor, and the prey must make an Intellect defense roll (difficulty 4) or be phased into the chronophage’s home dimension of time. Victims automatically phase back into reality on their next turn but are displaced by 100 feet (30 m) straight up or to the closest open space. This usually results in a fall that potentially deals 10 points of damage, knocks victims prone, and dazes them, hindering all actions for a round.</source>
